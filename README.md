# Clever Apprenticeship Projects

Hi Clever team! I'm Beck - a creative engineer transitioning from over a decade in nonprofit management, specifically in early childhood education, into software engineering. I left the nonprofit world in April to dedicate myself to independent study and technical growth. These three frontend projects were built specifically for the Clever Software Engineer Apprenticeship to showcase my coding skills, product thinking, and alignment with your mission to connect every student to a world of learning.

Each project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and reflects my commitment to user empathy, clarity, and collaboration.

## Projects

### Student Dashboard UI
A responsive dashboard for students to track their schedule, assignments, and study streaks.
-Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, LocalStorage

### Digital Learning Tool Finder
Search and filter educational tools by category and grade level - includes real links to Kahoot!, PBS, National Geographic, and more.
-Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM filtering

### Collaborative Coding Journal
Log and reflect on coding sessions with mood tracking, shareable entries, and delete functionality.
-Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, LocalStorage

## Why These Projects Matter
These projects reflect my ability to:
-Build intuitive, accessible user interfaces
-Solve real problems with thoughtful design
-Collaborate and iterate with empathy
-Align engineering work with product goals and user needs

They also represent my journey - from supporting young learners in classrooms to building tools that empwer them through technology. Thank you for considering my application. I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute to Clever's mission and grow as an engineer on your team.
