## Why It Matters
This project reflects my commitment to learning through reflection and collaboration - values that align with Clever's mission to empower students. It demonstrates my ability to build intuitive interfaces, handle user input, and manage client-side data.

## How to Run
Opne 'index.html' in any modern browser. No installation is required.

## Reflection
I built this project to practice DOM manipulation, form handling, and state persistence. If expanded, I'dd add tagging, filtering, and export options to support deeper journaling and peer collaboration.
