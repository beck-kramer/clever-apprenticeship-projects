## Why It Matters
This project demonstrates my ability to build user-friendly interfaces, work with structured data, and think like a product designer. It reflects Clever's mission by helping users access digital learning tools in a secure, intuitive way - and shows how I approach frontend development with empathy and clarity.

## How to Run
Open 'index.html' in any modern browser. No installation required.

## Reflection
I built this project to practice filtering logic, UI responsiveness, and user-centered design. If expanded, I'd add grade-level filters, tool tagging, and persistent favorites using local storage or a backend.
